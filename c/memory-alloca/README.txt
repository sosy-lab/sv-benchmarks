[comment by Ondrej Lengal (11 Oct 2015):

  Termination examples were removed in commit ab3a198 (they are already in
  termination-memory-alloca/) except c.03-alloca_true-valid-memsafety.c, which
  was left as a representing example of a hard termination example with trivial
  memory safety.

  Array examples were moved to array-memory/ in commit f3f1cdf .
